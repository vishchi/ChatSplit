## Introduction
I have developed a full fledged Realtime Chat Application. I have used JavaScript Libraries like React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 


## Setup
- Run ```npm i``` on both server and client ends to install nodemon package manager.
- Run ```npm start``` for both client and server side to start the chat server.

## Run
[React Run](http://localhost:3000/)
